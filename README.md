# Combining-Optimization-and-Simulation-Using-Logic-Based-Benders-Decomposition
An associated Github for our paper _Combining Optimization and Simulation Using Logic-Based Benders Decomposition_ containing code and results. Published by the European Journal of Operational Research: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2023.07.032

You will need a working Gurobi (www.gurobi.com) installation with a current license to run the code.
The repository contains logic-based Benders decomposition formulations of a Nursing Home Shift Scheduling (NHSS) problem, and an Airport Check-in Counter Allocation (ACCA) problem. There is also a direct IP formulation of the NHSS problem.
