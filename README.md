# Combining-Optimization-and-Simulation-Using-Logic-Based-Benders-Decomposition
An associated Github for our paper _Combining Optimization and Simulation Using Logic-Based Benders Decomposition_ containing code and results. The paper is currently a pre-print, and has not yet been peer reviewed.
You will need a working Gurobi (www.gurobi.com) installation with a current license to run the code.
To test the code just run a main file. You can change the parameters in the associated settings files.
Result outputs used in the paper are available in ''results.'' To get all files below 25MB the instances and results have been zipped.
